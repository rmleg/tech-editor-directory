Specifics and specialties: Knit tech editing, charts, schematics, input on graphic design/layout. I work in Word (using track changes or highlighted notes) or marking up PDFs in Adobe Acrobat. I can create or edit charts using Envisioknit, Stitchmastery or Knit Visualizer. I create schematics in Illustrator. Iâ€™ve helped many new designers with their patterns for the KP IDP. I believe that tech editing is a partnership between the editor and designer. I also teach classes on developing your own style sheet and self publishing.
