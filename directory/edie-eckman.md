I tech edit both knit and crochet, and create charts and schematics in Illustrator. I teach a class on pattern writing on Craftsy.com, which I encourage my new clients to take to save money in the long run. Although I prefer not to do grading, I will work with the designer to make sure his/her grading is accurate. Hourly rates. Availability depends on a number of factors; please send inquiries via email.
